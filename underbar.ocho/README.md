#The Ocho

Welcome to a new way of thinking of Java.

Java is a lot of things, but it isn't cool. The Ocho is cool.

It is a functional library that harnesses the full power of Java 8's type inference and lambda.

It brings Optional<T> to the forefront making it easier to work with.

It provides functions that make working with Java's core data structures much less painful.

It is the home of all of your favourite functional tools.
